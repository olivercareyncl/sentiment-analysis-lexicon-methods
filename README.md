# **Sentiment Analysis with VADER and TextBlob**

## **Project Overview**

This project provides a simple demonstration of sentiment analysis using two lexicon-based methods: **VADER** and **TextBlob**. The goal is to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral, and compare the performance of both models. The analysis highlights sentiment distributions, model accuracy, and key differences between VADER and TextBlob.
