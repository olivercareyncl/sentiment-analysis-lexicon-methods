## Overview
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine whether data is positive, negative, or neutral. In this project, we explore lexicon-based sentiment analysis methods like **VADER** and **TextBlob**. These approaches are particularly useful for analyzing social media, product reviews, and other text datasets.

## Dataset
Weâ€™ve provided a sample dataset `sample_texts.csv` located in the `data/` folder. This dataset contains sample text for performing sentiment analysis, but feel free to use your own datasets.

## How to Use

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-lexicon-methods.git
cd sentiment-analysis-lexicon-methods
